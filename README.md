# Berlin_Vaccine_Bot
This bot looks for available appointments **in the next 14 days** at the following places:
- Berlin Vaccination Centers
- GKH Havelh√∂he 

When the bot finds an appointment, it opens up a new tab on the active browser where you can choose the date and time and book the slot. The bot also pauses for 30 seconds when it finds an appointment to allow for the booking to complete. It will automatically resume after 30 seconds and keep looking for a slot **in the next 14 days**.
